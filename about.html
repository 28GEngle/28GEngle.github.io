            <p style="font-size: 20px;">I like doing computer stuff like this, playing computer games, and making things (I don't like making sections about me though but that doesn't really matter now). I'm in 9th grade and I'm making this site as a final for a class i'm taking about programming. I think the class went well, because obviously I made this myself without much help. (Don't murder my grade for making picture frames below because it looks too similar to the card thing we did earlier, 100% made-by-me code)</p>

            <p style="font-size: 20px;">I don't currently have any extra-curricular activies right now, but I was thinking about joining your game dev club thing or whatever it is towards the end of the year but never really got around to it. I like cars and I wish I could drive but sadly I'm not legally allowed to yet. I'm sure it'd be pretty easy though once you learn all the traffic signs and what they mean. It's just gas... brake... gas... brake... turn the wheel, etc, right? I could think of a few things that I like... I like pizza, cars, computers, burgers, and making things like this website :)</p>
