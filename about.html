        <p>Minecraft is a nice game. It is a game where you can use your imagination to make things like lava casts and creeper holes in peoples worlds, But theres more to it than that. you can add a bunch of cool mods to enhance your experiences like a gravestone mod to make sure your stuff doesn't despawn when you inevitably die to the monsters that lurk at night, or a backpack mod to make sure you can carry all of your stuff with you whereever you go if the vanilla inventory is just a little too small for your convenience.</p>
        <br>
        <p>My favorite activities to do in minecraft is to do random things. A few things I could do which would fall under the "random" category would be to entirely remove a chunk (including the bedrock), make multiple homes, or grief a village.</p>

        <h2>Thing to write about #2 :D</h2>
        <img src="" alt="">
        <p>Writing isn't my best subject, of course, but when I'm given the instruction "Fill your websites article" I just gotta ramble about random stuff like the state of the ceiling tile above me. The tile is particulary interesting at this time, consisting of 13 bigger dots than the rest of the dots all over the tile. Other than that, its not very much different than the tiles around it. But the tile next to it is pretty nice, It's got two fluorescent lamps to the left and right of it but both lamps have a burnt out strip in them so its more like 1 and a half lamps. My tile is pretty nice as well if we're talking about stuff next to it. It's got the air circulation vent tile next to it, however the vent is on the opposite side of the tile so it's not very close, but its still on the tile nearby.</p>
